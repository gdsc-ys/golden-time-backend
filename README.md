## Technologies
- Node.js with express, firebase-admin, forever, morgan, mysql, nodemon
- Firebase
- MySQL

## Prerequisites
- Node.js: v18.12.1 (minimum)
- MySQL: v8.0.32 (minimum)
- Firebase Project and its Project Key
- Cloud Computing Environment (to deploy)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the project.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gdsc-ys/golden-time-backend.git
    ```
2. Make folder `/auth` which will contain your authentication information.
3. Make `fbAuth.json` to save your Firebase authentication information with following format:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "",
        "project_id": "",
        "private_key_id": "",
        "private_key": "",
        "client_email": "",
        "client_id": "",
        "auth_uri": "",
        "token_uri": "",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
        "client_x509_cert_url": ""
    }
    ```
4. Make `sqlAuth.json` to save you MySQL authentication information with following format:
    ```json
    {
        "host": "",
        "user": "",
        "password": "",
        "database": ""
    }
    ```
5. Run MySQL and run `source databaseDump.sql;` to set up database and some sample datas. If you are re-setting the database, note that you should delete the previous database with ```drop database `gdsc-ys-golden-time`;```.
6. Run `npm init` to initialize app you cloned. This will automatically install all of the required packages.
7. Run `npm start` to execute the server. You can make the app to run persistently with some packages you prefer. I will provide a example deploying server with `tmux` and `forever`.
    ```bash
        tmux new -s deploy
        forever --minUpTime=1000 --spinSleepTime=1000 start -c â€˜npm startâ€™ ./
    ```
